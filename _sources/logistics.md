## Travel

* Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the
  University of Washington Campus.
* The Link light rail is an easy, great way to get to the UW campus from the
  airport. It picks you up at the airport, comes about every 5-15 minutes, and
  drops you off right on the UW campus; just a 15-minute walk from the dorms you
  will be staying in.
* From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light
  Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the
  parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The
  cost is $3.00 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the
  northbound train toward Northgate to the University of Washington station (
  Note: do not get off at the University Street Station!).
* Taxiâ€™s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for
  uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.
* Incurred travel costs for participants provided event support funds will be
  reconciled after the GeoSMART Hackweek event.

## Health and Safety
* While we will not require masking at this event some may feel more comfortable
  bringing their own mask and wearing it. We will have some masks on hand for
  anyone who needs one.
* During the event, if you are feeling unwell or experiencing cold-like symptoms,
  COVID tests will be available at the registration table. If you test positive,
  we ask that you self-isolate the hotel where you will be able to join hackweek
  activities virtually.
* University of Washington guidelines relating to COVID are [available to review online](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/).
* In the event of some unforeseen emergency, directions will be given via the
  Slack #general channel and in person by the event support lead.
